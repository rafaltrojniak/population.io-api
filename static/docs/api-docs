        "description": "<p>This is the World Bank's World Population API.<h4>Access Restrictions</h4><p>All endpoints are free and publicly accessible to everyone from everywhere.<h4>Requests</h4><p>All endpoints take only GET HTTP requests, with all arguments given as path parameters (in the URL).<h4>Responses</h4><p>The response format depends on the 'Accept' header.<p>The standard response format is JSON (application/json) with CORS for cross-domain requests.<p>Alternatively, you can request JSONP (application/javascript). Use the query parameter 'callback' to change the callback function name.<p>All endpoints can also return HTML (text/html) to support experimentation in the browser. Additionally, there's an API browser (what you are seeing right now) that allows exploration of all endpoints.<h4>Date and offset formats</h4><p>Dates are accepted and returned in the ISO8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD. That is, a four-digit year, a two-digit month and a two-digit day, separated by hyphens. Valid examples are: 1952-03-11 and 1969-07-20.<p>A special format called 'offset' is used across the API. Offsets can take one of two different forms: they can either be given as a simple number, in which case this number is assumed to represent a certain number of days. Alternatively, a string in the format '##y##m##d' can be used to represent a certain number of years, months and days. All three parts are optional, but at least one has to be given. Valid examples are: 468 (468 days), 3y11m5d (3 years, 11 months and 5 days), 25y1d (25 years and 1 day), 6m (six months).<h4>Data Sources</h4><p><a href=\"http://esa.un.org/wpp/\">World Population Prospects (2012 Revision)</a>, United Nations Population Division (released in 2013)<p>1. <a href=\"https://github.com/worldpopulation/population.io-api/blob/master/data/WPP2012_INT_F3_Population_By_Sex_Annual_Single_100_Medium.zip\">WPP2012_INT_F3_Population_By_Sex_Annual_Single_100_Medium.csv</a>: Annual population distribution by single age and sex: for the period 1950-2010 (estimates) and 2011-2100 (Medium projection) for 196 countries with population size greater than 100,000 (in 2010) as well as for several UN World regions. <p>2. Age specific period life expectancy by sex - 5 yearly interval for age and duration -    for the period 1950-2010 (estimates) and 2010-2100 (projections).   Data were extracted from a file obtained from the UN on request. <h4>Method: Interpolation</h4><p>1. Annual population by age in single year and sex in 1st July of each year were first interpolated to single day by fitting spline function.    For e.g. interpolated between 1 year old in 1st July 2010 and 1 year old in 1st July 2011 to get 1 year olds in 2nd July 2010 to 30th June 2011<p> 2. The daily population by age in single year and sex were interpolated for ages in days by fitting spline function.   For e.g. Interpolated between 1 year old and 2 years old, assigning the 1 year old to 365+183 days of exact age   and 2 years old to 364*2 + 183 days and so on.<p>3. Remaining life expectancy at specific age (in days) were obtained by interpolating (spline) the 5 yearly/duration age-specific period life expetancies.<h4>List of Endpoints</h4><p>Click endpoint to expand."
