        "description": "<p>This is the World Bank's World Population API.<h4>Access Restrictions</h4><p>All endpoints are free and publicly accessible to everyone from everywhere.<h4>Requests</h4><p>All endpoints take only GET HTTP requests, with all arguments given as path parameters (in the URL).<h4>Responses</h4><p>The response format depends on the 'Accept' header.<p>The standard response format is JSON (application/json) with CORS for cross-domain requests.<p>Alternatively, you can request JSONP (application/javascript). Use the query parameter 'callback' to change the callback function name.<p>All endpoints can also return HTML (text/html) to support experimentation in the browser. Additionally, there's an API browser (what you are seeing right now) that allows exploration of all endpoints.<p>All endpoints set the Cache-Control header. The endpoint URL and the Accept header are the only variable values required to determine a cache hit.<h4>Date and Offset Formats</h4><p>Dates are accepted and returned in the ISO8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD. That is, a four-digit year, a two-digit month and a two-digit day, separated by hyphens. Valid examples are: 1952-03-11 and 1969-07-20.<p>A special format called 'offset' is used across the API. Offsets can take one of two different forms: they can either be given as a simple number, in which case this number is assumed to represent a certain number of days. Alternatively, a string in the format '##y##m##d' can be used to represent a certain number of years, months and days. All three parts are optional, but at least one has to be given. Valid examples are: 468 (468 days), 3y11m5d (3 years, 11 months and 5 days), 25y1d (25 years and 1 day), 6m (six months).<h4>Data Sources and  Methodology</h4><p>See <a href='https://github.com/worldpopulation/population.io-api/tree/master/modeling'>https://github.com/worldpopulation/population.io-api/tree/master/modeling</a></p><h4>List of Endpoints</h4><p>Click endpoint to expand."
