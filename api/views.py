def wprank_by_age(request, dob, gender, country, age):
    """ Calculates the world population rank of a person with the given date of birth, gender and country of origin on a certain date as expressed by the person's age.

    The world population rank is defined as the position of someone's birthday when compared to the entire world population ordered by date of birth decreasing. That is, the last person born is assigned rank #1.

    Based on the date of birth and the given age, a calculation date is computed. This date may lie in the future (by specifying an age the person hasn't reached yet). Then the world population rank of the person on that day is calculated.

    The age can be given as a simple number, in which case it is assumed to be days since birth. Alternatively, the age can be specified in years, months and days, using the format "##y##m##d", e.g. "18y1m5d" to denote the day one month and five days after the 18th birthday. All three values are optional (or may be zero), but at least one of them must be given.

    Parameters:
       * dob: the person's date of birth (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
       * gender: the person's gender (valid values: male, female, unisex)
       * country: the person's country of origin (valid values: see /meta/countries, use 'WORLD' for all)
       * age: the time interval after the person's birth at which to calculate the world population rank, either given in days (e.g. '1000') or in a combination of years, months and days (e.g. '3y6m9d')

    Examples:
       * /api/1.0/wp-rank/1952-03-11/male/United%20Kingdom/age/100/: calculates the world population rank a hundred days after the person's birth
       * /api/1.0/wp-rank/1952-03-11/male/United%20Kingdom/age/6m/: calculates the world population rank when the person was six months old

def wprank_ago(request, dob, gender, country, offset):
    """ Calculates the world population rank of a person with the given date of birth, gender and country of origin on a certain date as expressed by an offset relative to today.

    The world population rank is defined as the position of someone's birthday when compared to the entire world population ordered by date of birth decreasing. That is, the last person born is assigned rank #1.

    Based on today's date (the current date in UTC) and the offset parameter, a calculation date is computed. Then the world population rank of the person on that day is calculated.

    The offset parameter can be given as a simple number, in which case it is assumed to be days before today. Alternatively, the offset parameter can be specified in years, months and days, using the format "##y##m##d", e.g. "8y1m5d" to denote the day eight years, one month and five days ago. All three values are optional (or may be zero), but at least one of them must be given.

    Specifying a date before the person's birth (i.e. giving a higher value than the person's age as an offset) will result in an error.

       * dob: the person's date of birth (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
       * gender: the person's gender (valid values: male, female, unisex)
       * country: the person's country of origin (valid values: see /meta/countries, use 'WORLD' for all)
